# MY_NLP_WORLD_2_CLASSIFICATION

This is a way to categorize a given set of documents or texts into a class or categories, assuming that we have predefined set of classes. For this case I am performing a supervised learning approach on the Machicon Japan dataset from the clients complains and reviews. 
For this task I have perfomed the following Algorithms or methodologies:
### 1.Random Forest with TF-IDF and FastText;
### 2.Logistic Regression TF-IDF and FastText;
### 3.MVM TF-IDF and FastText;
### 4.KNN TF-IDF and FastText;

In the future I would like to perform the same methodologies applying ELMO and Glove.
